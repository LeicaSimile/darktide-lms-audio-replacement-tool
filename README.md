### Intended for use as a dependency for other mods.

Example usage:
```lua
local LMS_AudioTool = get_mod("LMS-AudioTool")
LMS_AudioTool.set_replacement_audio("my_music.mp3")
```

Note: This mod comes with an MIT license, meaning you can just take what you need from it and directly add it to your mod if you don't want an external dependency. :)
